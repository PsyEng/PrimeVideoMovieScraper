# PrimeVideoMovieScraper
This is a basic movie scraper that uses Selenium and fetches all the movies and their metadata from PrimeVideo and stores it in a database.
There are a lot of movie library APIs out there but the main objective of this project was to showcase the advantages of ORM (Object Relation Mapping) using Flask-SQLAlchemy library. Here, within 300 lines of code, I scrape all the movies from PrimeVideo, create ORM object and push it to a remote database.
